# Lost n Hound

## Inspiration
For many people, their pets are beloved members of their family and it is a tragedy when they go missing. Over 35% of cats that go missing are never found and, while dogs fare better with only 7% never returning, a lost pet leaves a hole in the ownersâ€™ hearts.

Lost n Hound is a service that will reduce those numbers with the goal of returning every lost pet safely to their home.

## What it does
Lost n Hound is a web app that allows pet owners to quickly and easily create a unique website for their pet that displays different information depending on if they are current missing. Owners can update that information at any time and choose what is visible to the public. Then, owners can order a collar tag with their pet's unique URL printed on it. If a stranger or shelter finds their pet, they can go to the website to see if the pet is lost and, if they are, contact the owners.

While microchips and traditional collars help increase the chances of being found, there are problems with each that Lost n Hound can improve upon. For example, there is no universal microchip and not all vets and shelters carry scanners that can detect every microchip. As another example, most people don't assume cats wandering around outside are lost, but with Lost n Hound, a stranger can quickly check to see if the cat is lost or simply exploring the neighborhood.

## How I built it
Lost n Hound is a web app that uses React, Firebase, Javascript, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.
